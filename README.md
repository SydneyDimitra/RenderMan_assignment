# RenderMan_assignment
RenderMan assigment using the Python API: Rendering a static scene with a main object

Main object was selected to be a dark chocolate bar.
The chocolate bar is placed in a kitchen environment 
and the scene is populated by a marble table surface where the bar is placed, a wall and a teapot in the background.
The project was completed using Python code that generated the rib file for RenderMan.

## Repository contents
* BAR
* ENVIRONMENT
* FINAL_RENDERS
* NOISE
* TABLE
* COMMON

## Execution
First the shader were compiled using the 'oslc *.osl' command line in the Linuxx terminal, 
which generates the .oso shader files.
The images where rendered using the Renderman visualization programme "it", 
by executing the python file using the terminal which generated and sends the RIB files to the already open programme "it".
