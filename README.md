RenderMan assigment: Rendering a static scene with a main object

Main object was selected to be a dark chocolate bar.
The chocolate bar is placed in a kitchen environment 
and the scene is populated by a marble table surface where the bar is placed, a wall and a teapot in the background.
The project was completed using Python code that generated the rib file for RenderMan.
